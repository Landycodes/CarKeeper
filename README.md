# CarKeeper

A personal app to keep track of car maintenance intervals. To use the app, simply select the work that was performed on your vehicle (e.g. oil change, coolant flush) and enter your vehicle's current mileage. Your input will be saved to the dashboard with the mileage of when your next maintenance procedure is due. You can change your interval mileage depending on your vehicle's needs, as well as save your car's specifications like make, model, VIN, and more. You can also save the status of your car parts, like your brake width and tire tread depth.

Originally, this app used vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It has been refactored to use jQuery for app functionality and uses the browser's "localStorage" to save input data for the next time the site is used. This application is completely front-end built and will have a
<br>
back-end database implemented in the next version to come.
